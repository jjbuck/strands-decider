"""Generate hard decision questions over realistic documents with a Bedrock model.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT NEEDS TO DO (read this before changing anything on the other box)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: training data like the unreleased stage 2 of decider-2b v11 -- realistic business
documents, each with 3-4 typed questions whose answers need careful reading. The data is
for Hobson, a System One model that answers typed decisions (yes/no "noul", or "choice"
among named options) in one forward pass. See research/preregistrations/PREREGISTRATION-v15.md for
why: short public rule data (ShARC) did not transfer to JevBench; decider's long, varied
documents did.

It runs in three stages, each resumable (rerun the same command to continue):

  1. write   For each document, sample a domain, a document kind and 3-4 skills. Ask the
             model for ONE document (roughly 700-1,600 words) and one question per skill,
             each with its options and the writer's answer. Store the raw output.
  2. verify  Ask every question twice more, each in a fresh context, with the options
             shuffled and WITHOUT the writer's answer. Keep a question only if both
             answers agree with the writer's (decider kept 89-91% this way).
  3. export  Write kept questions as strands-decider training rows (JSONL, one Example per line:
             kind, state, instructions, options [[name, description], ...], label, task),
             split by domain: documents in --heldout-domains go to the eval file only.

Rules that must survive any fix:
  * NO JEVBENCH CONTENT. The skills below were written from our own reading of which
    kinds of decisions fail, not from JevBench items. Never paste benchmark items into
    these prompts, and never use them as few-shot examples.
  * Every label comes from the writer AND two agreeing verifiers. Don't relax the filter
    to raise yield. Hard questions the model cannot answer consistently are dropped,
    which caps difficulty at the model's own ability. That's the known cost.
  * Difficulty is measured back on the training box, not here: v14's accuracy on the
    kept questions should be well below 90% or the data is too easy to help.

Things likely to need fixing on the other box:
  * MODEL ID / REGION. Nova Premier is reached through a cross-region inference profile
    ("us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0" in US regions). If the Converse call fails with a
    validation or access error, check the model ID in the Bedrock console, and that model
    access is granted in the region.
  * QUOTAS. Nova Premier's default tokens-per-minute quota is low. Throttling is retried
    (adaptive retries), but if it crawls, lower --workers or request a quota increase.
  * TIMEOUTS. A writer call produces ~3-5k tokens; read_timeout is 600 s.
  * JSON FROM THE WRITER. The writer is asked for a single JSON object. Malformed output
    is retried up to 3 times, then the document is logged as failed and skipped. If most
    fail to parse, look at failures.jsonl. Switching to Converse tool use with a forced
    tool (toolChoice) is the robust alternative, if the model supports it.
  * PRICES in --price-in / --price-out (USD per million tokens) are only for the cost
    estimate printed at the end. Set them from current Bedrock pricing.

This is the Nova pilot, kept as the record of its method; its export was removed before
publication because the rows did not record the model. For a new Bedrock run
use gen_documents_openrouter.py --backend bedrock (llm_client.py): the current prompts,
verification by a different model, and no boto3.

Usage (pilot):
    pip install boto3
    python gen_documents.py --out gen_pilot --docs 50
    # then copy gen_pilot/gen_train.jsonl, gen_pilot/gen_eval.jsonl (and docs.jsonl,
    # verify.jsonl for inspection) back to the training box.

The document:

- Invented organisation, people, products, amounts and dates; nothing about real companies.
- Specific and internally consistent: exact amounts, dates, roles, limits, conditions,
  exceptions. It must contain everything needed to answer the questions below, including
  the details the questions hinge on, placed naturally (not all next to each other).

Then write {n} questions about it, one for each of these skills, in this order:
{skills}

Each question:
- Applies the document to a specific case. Put the case facts in "case" (1-4 sentences:
  who, what, when, amounts). The case must not restate the answer.
- Has exactly one correct answer that follows from the document and the case alone.
  Work it out carefully before choosing it, and state that reasoning in "rationale".
- Is hard: a reader who skims, matches keywords, or ignores a clause should get it wrong.
- Is either type "noul" (a yes/no question) or type "choice" (3 to 6 named options).
  For "choice", every option is plausible and has a short name and a one-line description;
  include a "cannot be determined from the document" option where it is a real possibility.
  For "noul", give criteria: what makes the answer yes, and what makes it no, in general terms.
