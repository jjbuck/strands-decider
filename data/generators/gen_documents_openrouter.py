"""Generate hard decision questions over realistic documents through OpenRouter.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT NEEDS TO DO (read this before changing anything on the other box)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: training data like the unreleased stage 2 of decider-2b v11 -- realistic business
documents, each with 3-4 typed questions whose answers need careful reading. The data is
for Hobson, a System One model that answers typed decisions (yes/no "noul", or "choice"
among named options) in one forward pass. decider's writer was Qwen3.6-27B with thinking;
the default writer here is the same model, served through OpenRouter.

This is the second pilot. The first (gen_documents.py, Nova Premier on Bedrock) failed on
label quality: 7 of 30 hand-checked kept labels were wrong or ill-posed, because the
verifiers were the writer's own model and shared its misreadings. Documents were short
(median 536 words), a third of choice questions had letter-only option names, and many
questions were single-clause lookups. This version changes, in order of importance:
  * verification by a DIFFERENT model with thinking (--verify-models; default
    Qwen3.5-397B-A17B, a different size and generation from the writer);
  * thinking on for writer and verifiers;
  * validation: 700-2,200 words; meaningful option names (no "A", "Option B", "Both A and
    B"); each answer cites at least two sections (one for "underdetermined"); each
    choice question names its tempting wrong option ("lure"), which must be an option
    and must differ from the answer;
  * prompt: tradeoff/precedence answers must rest on a priority or precedence rule the
    document states; the case must not restate what the document says.

Stages, each resumable (rerun the same command to continue):
  1. write   For each document index, the SAME domain, kind and skills as the first pilot
             (same seed), so the two pilots compare document for document. The writer
             returns one document and one question per skill as JSON.
  2. verify  Every question is answered once by each model in --verify-models (twice by
             one model if only one is given), each in a fresh context, options shuffled,
             WITHOUT the writer's answer. A question is kept only if every answer agrees
             with the writer's.
  3. export  Kept questions become strands-decider training rows (JSONL, one Example per line:
             kind, state, instructions, options [[name, description], ...], label, task),
             split by domain: documents in HELDOUT_DOMAINS go to the eval file only.

Rules that must survive any fix:
  * NO JEVBENCH CONTENT. The skills were written from our own reading of which kinds of
    decision fail, not from benchmark items. Never paste benchmark items into prompts.
  * Every label needs the writer AND all verifiers to agree. Don't relax this to raise
    yield; a wrong label teaches the wrong reading, which is worse than no row.
  * Open-weight, Apache-2.0 models only (licensing). Qwen's API-only models ("max",
    "plus", "flash") are under Alibaba Cloud's terms instead, and Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B has a
    custom licence. Check the licence before changing --writer / --verify-models.
  * Difficulty is measured on the training box, not here.

Things likely to need fixing on the other box:
  * API KEY: export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... (never put it in this file).
  * PROVIDERS. OpenRouter routes each call to one of several hosts, some serving quantised
    weights. --quantizations (default bf16,fp16,fp32,fp8) excludes int4/int8 hosts; if a
    model then has no eligible host, calls fail with a 404/400 naming the provider
    filter. Widen the list, or pin hosts with --providers. The provider that served each
    call is recorded in docs.jsonl / verify.jsonl.
  * REASONING. Thinking is requested with {"reasoning": {"effort": ...}}. If a provider
    rejects it, try --reasoning-effort none (not recommended for verifiers).
  * JSON FROM THE WRITER. Malformed output is retried up to 3 times, then logged in
    failures.jsonl. If most documents fail, read those errors first.
  * RATE LIMITS. 429s are retried with backoff. Lower --workers if they persist.
  * COST. Each call asks OpenRouter to report its cost; the total is printed at the end.

After the second pilot (1/30 wrong labels, median 1,066 words; see
research/preregistrations/PREREGISTRATION-v16.md):
  * each question is assigned its type (~30% yes/no, the pilot's share; "underdetermined"
    always choice) and, if yes/no, its answer (50/50) -- the pilot got 34 "no" to 13
    "yes", and a yes/no target on every question made the writer use yes/no for 86% of
    them (documents doc00000-doc00070 of the v16 run were written that way). Questions
    that ignore their assigned type or answer are dropped at write;
  * writing and verification share one pool, and a document is verified as soon as it
    is written (verification jobs go first); --workers calls are in flight at once;
  * --max-cost stops starting new calls past a spend; rerun with a higher cap to resume.

--skill-set targeted swaps in a second set of ten skills aimed at where v16 still trails
(withdrawn instructions, nested exceptions, definitions, judging a described action,
facts across artefacts, the rule version in force, running totals, tie-breaks, missing
facts, boundary cases), with five extra document kinds that carry amendments and
bundled artefacts. --skill-set mixed adds back five v16 skills (all conditions, exception,
precedence, dates, lookup chain) so two thirds of questions are targeted. --skill-set weak
draws the mixed skills with the five v16 did worst on in the mixed pilot four times as
likely (63% of questions). The default, v16, reproduces the specs of data/generators/gen_v16/
exactly, as mixed does data/generators/gen_mixed_pilot/'s.

After the mixed pilot (2 of 30 hand-checked labels wrong, both a case silently omitting
a precondition the answer depends on, missed by writer and verifiers alike): the writer
must state every fact the deciding rules' conditions depend on, and the verifier must
not assume an unstated fact.

Usage:
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    python gen_documents_openrouter.py --out gen_v16 --docs 1000 --seed 1 --max-cost 90
    python gen_documents_openrouter.py --out gen_targeted_pilot --docs 50 --seed 2 \\
        --skill-set targeted --max-cost 9
    # copy the whole output directory back to the training box.

Backends (llm_client.py): --backend openrouter (default), bedrock, or bedrock-mantle, or the
environment variable HOBSON_LLM_BACKEND. Bedrock takes a Bedrock API key in
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK (or, on bedrock-runtime, the AWS credential chain if botocore is
installed) and --region. Its default models are not the ones that produced the committed
data; every row records backend, model and provider:
    export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...
    python gen_documents_openrouter.py --backend bedrock --region us-west-2 --out gen_bedrock_pilot \\
        --docs 20 --price-in <USD per M input tokens> --price-out <USD per M output tokens> --max-cost 5

Output a single JSON object and nothing else."""

WRITER_PROMPT = """Write one realistic {kind} for an organisation, in the domain of {domain}.

The document:
- 900 to 1,600 words of plain text, in 6 to 10 numbered sections (lists and simple text
  tables are fine). Invented organisation, people, products, amounts and dates.
- Specific and internally consistent: exact amounts, dates, roles, limits, conditions,
  exceptions, and where two rules can collide, a stated rule for which one prevails.
- Contains everything needed to answer the questions below. Put the details a question
  hinges on in DIFFERENT sections, never next to each other.

Then write {n} questions about it, one for each of these skills, in this order:
{skills}

Each question:
- Applies the document to a specific case, given in "case" (1-4 sentences: who, what, when,
  amounts). The case gives facts about the situation only; it never restates, paraphrases
  or summarises the document's rules, and never hints at the answer.
- States in the case every fact that the conditions of the deciding rules depend on
  (dates and times, amounts, roles, statuses, whether a triggering event happened). Never
  rely on a condition being met, or unmet, without saying so. If the answer is meant to
  hinge on a missing fact, the correct answer is "cannot be determined from the document".
- Has exactly one correct answer that follows from the document and the case alone. The
  answer must depend on at least two separate sections (list them in "evidence"; for
  "underdetermined", the sections that come closest). For tradeoff and precedence
  questions, one of those sections must be the priority or precedence rule that decides.
- Is hard: a reader who skims, matches keywords, or applies only the most obvious clause
  gets it wrong. Name that tempting wrong answer in "lure".
- Has the TYPE given after its skill above: "noul" (yes/no) or "choice" (3 to 6 options).
  A noul question's correct answer MUST be the one given there; build the trap in the
  other direction (for "yes", something that looks disqualifying but is not).
  "choice": every option is plausible, with a meaningful short name (e.g. "Regional
  Manager", "Refund in full", "Not eligible") -- never letters or "Option A", and never
  an option that refers to other options ("Both A and B"). Include "cannot be determined
  from the document" as an option where it is a real possibility.
  "noul": give criteria -- in general terms, what makes the answer yes and what makes it no.

Before writing the JSON, check every answer against the document clause by clause. If a
question has more than one defensible answer, rewrite it.

JSON format:
{{
  "title": "...",
  "document": "...",
  "questions": [
