"""Generate answer-adequacy judgements (request, response, adequate?) through OpenRouter.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
JevBench's `adequacy` family asks whether a saved answer adequately answers a request.
Nothing in Hobson's training corpus asks that, and v17 answers "adequate" to 92% of
HelpSteer2's validation responses (catching 7% of the inadequate ones) and to 11 of the
family's 12 public tasks. This script writes the missing kind of row: a realistic
request to an assistant, a response to it, and whether the response is adequate.

Same models, client and rules as gen_documents_openrouter.py (imported from it):
  * NO JEVBENCH CONTENT. Request categories, defects and "adequate despite appearances"
    kinds are our own, written from the family's one-line description ("answer adequacy
    judging"), never from benchmark items.
  * Writer Qwen3.6-27B; each item is judged twice by Qwen3.5-397B-A17B, in fresh
    contexts, without the writer's verdict. An item is kept only if both judgements
    agree with the writer's. Apache-2.0 open-weight models only.

Stages (resumable; rerun the same command to continue):
  1. write   Each batch has one request category and six items, each ASSIGNED its
             verdict (three adequate, three not, shuffled) and a kind: for inadequate
             items a specific defect, for adequate ones either a plain good answer or
             one that looks flawed but is not (terse, informal, corrects a false
             premise...). Assigned verdicts keep the labels balanced, and the
             look-flawed kinds keep "looks rough" from predicting "no".
  2. verify  Each item judged twice.
  3. export  Kept items become strands-decider noul rows (task "gen:adequacy"), in the format of
             src/strands_decider/data/adequacy.py. Batches in HELDOUT_CATEGORIES go to the eval
             file only.

Usage:
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    python gen_adequacy_openrouter.py --out gen_adequacy_pilot --batches 20 --max-cost 3
    # or, on Amazon Bedrock (see llm_client.py; other models, so new data, not the committed data):
    export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...
    python gen_adequacy_openrouter.py --backend bedrock --region us-west-2 --out gen_adequacy_bedrock --batches 5

Each item has a user's request (1-8 sentences; include any passage, data or figures the
request depends on) and an assistant's response (40-350 words). Requests must differ
from one another in topic and wording. Invent names and details.

Each item is assigned a verdict and a kind; follow them exactly:
{items}

An item is ADEQUATE if the response correctly and completely does what the request asks,
respects every explicit constraint in it, and has no error that matters. Style, brevity
or small typos alone never make a response inadequate. An item is INADEQUATE if it has
the assigned defect, and the defect is unambiguous once noticed, but not flagged,
apologised for or hinted at in the response. Inadequate responses should read as fluent
and confident as adequate ones; adequate responses of the rough-looking kinds must be
genuinely adequate.

Check each response against its request, line by line, before writing the JSON. If a
verdict could reasonably be disputed, rewrite the item.

JSON format:
{{"items": [
  {{"verdict": "adequate" | "inadequate", "kind": "<the kind assigned>",
