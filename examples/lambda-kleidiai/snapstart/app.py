"""Lambda entry point (handler "app.handler") of strands-decider-2b-v2 and -v2q: PR #77's handler.py, unchanged, plus
two things around it.

1. {"mode": "native_eval", "in": "s3://.../shard.jsonl.gz", "out": "s3://.../out/shard.jsonl.gz"} runs eval_np.run_shard
   on the loaded engine (the deployed image's eval mode, torch-free); the result is the shard's stats.
2. A direct invocation's response also carries "timing" {"engine_s", "init_s", "threads", "cpu"}, the deployed
   handler's field, so client/drive.py and bench/lambda_shim.py run unchanged. engine_s is PR #77's latency_ms / 1000
   (engine.evaluate), and cpu is the CPU part of the host serving this request (a SnapStart snapshot restores on any).
Everything else, including the function-URL routes, the SnapStart load at import and the memfd weights, is PR #77's.

v2b: OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS defaults to 1, set before numpy loads. numpy's OpenBLAS otherwise starts one worker per
vCPU for the pointer head's float64 products, and its idle workers busy-wait after every call, on the cores llama.cpp's
6 OpenMP threads need for the next forward: on Graviton3 at 6 threads that added about 33 ms to every forward of the
eval mode (0.490 vs 0.456 s p50 at <= 512 tokens, the deployed engine 0.456 s). One BLAS thread costs the head about
1 ms and gives the same log-probs. An OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS in the function's environment still wins.
