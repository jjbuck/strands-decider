"""Catch a tool call the agent *shouldn't* make yet, and send it back to ask first.

**Experimental.** This is a demo -- a sample of the kind of judgement you can put in this
seam, written to be read rather than deployed. The questions, the thresholds and the policy
are all illustrative: choose your own, and fit them to your own traffic. None of it is
recommended for production as it stands.

This gates a tool call on something subtle: whether the call is even well-formed given
the conversation so far. The agent proposes a tool call; the strands-decider model answers
two narrow yes/no questions about it -- are the arguments grounded in what the user
actually said, and is the call premature -- and a plain-Python policy turns those
probabilities into `Guide` (send the model back with feedback) or `Proceed` (let it run).

The seam is `InterventionHandler.before_tool_call`, which runs before Strands executes the
tool. The verdict is what makes this different from a hard allow/deny gate: `Guide` does
not refuse the call, it *corrects the course*, the model gets the feedback and takes
another turn, typically asking the user the question it should have asked in the first
place.

    strands-decider serve <checkpoint> --port 8099
    python examples/strands/tool_call_intervention.py

The scenario is deliberately small: one `get_weather` tool and one incomplete request
("What's the weather?" with no city). The agent is given an eager system prompt so it
guesses a location instead of asking, exactly the failure mode the gate is meant to
catch. strands-decider flags the guessed argument as ungrounded, and the policy returns a
`Guide` that sends the model back to ask the user which city they meant.

Why classify instead of letting the agent self-check? The check is cheap and it
has to be honest, a general chat model asked "are your own arguments grounded?" is possible
to talk out of a no. The gate is a local forward pass in a couple of hundred
milliseconds, the conversation never leaves the machine, and each verdict is a number your
`if` statements branch on rather than prose the agent negotiates with.

Needs AWS credentials for Bedrock to drive the agent. The gate needs only the local
server, so swap `model=` for any Strands model provider and the strands-decider half is
unchanged. STRANDS_DECIDER_URL overrides the endpoint (default http://127.0.0.1:8099).

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the questions
#
# Two narrow yes/no (noul) questions, each a single judgement: one about the arguments, one
# about the timing. strands-decider answers each with P(true) in 0..1; it never decides the
# action. The `true`/`false` descriptions carry most of the signal, so they are worth
# writing as carefully as the questions themselves.
