"""A small synchronous client for a running decision-model server.

Deliberately `urllib` rather than a client library: these examples should need nothing
beyond `strands-agents`, so that a reader can drop one into their own project without
first agreeing to a dependency.

Synchronous on purpose too. Strands calls a handler method that is a plain `def`
directly, so a blocking request is the simplest thing that works -- and it keeps requests
to the server strictly sequential, which is how it is best driven: one request at a time.

**Renaming.** The product name is spelled out in exactly one place, `NAME` below, and the
things derived from it sit directly underneath. Everything else -- this module's filename,
the `Decider` class, the demos -- is named for what it does rather than what it is called,
so a future rename is an edit to this block and nothing else.
