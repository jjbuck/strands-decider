"""Do two devices give the same answers? One checkpoint, a fixed request set, one device at a time.

The request set covers both of the engine's paths: one question per request (the whole prompt
in one forward) and five per request (the shared-prefix path, which hands Gated DeltaNet state
across), states from about 40 to about 3,000 tokens, and every question type. Each device's
answers are compared against the first device's: the largest probability difference, and how
many chosen answers changed.

    python evaluation/device_parity.py checkpoints/hobson-2b-v19 --device mps --device mlx
    python evaluation/device_parity.py StrandsAgents/strands-decider-2B-hobson-v19 \
        --device cpu --device mlx --out parity.json

Devices load one after another, and each engine is released before the next loads.
